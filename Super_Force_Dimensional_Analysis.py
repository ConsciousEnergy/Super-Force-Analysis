## Dimensional Analysis Results\n
\n
Here are the detailed results of the dimensional analysis performed on the equations related to the Super Force theory:\n
\n
- **Superforce (SF):** The dimensions are `{Dimension(G): -1, Dimension(c): 4}`, which are consistent with the dimensions of force. The gravitational constant \( G \) has the dimension of \( [M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}] \) and the speed of light \( c \) has the dimension of \( [LT^{-1}] \). The combination \( c^4/G \) indeed gives us the dimension of force \( [MLT^{-2}] \).\n
\n
- **Strong Nuclear Force (FSN):** The dimensions are identical to the Superforce, which is expected since the equation provided for the Strong Nuclear Force is the same as that for the Superforce.\n
\n
- **Electromagnetic Force (FEM):** The dimensions are `{Dimension(LP): -2, Dimension(k): -1, Dimension(q): 2}`. This is consistent with the formula for force in the context of electromagnetism, where \( LP \) likely represents the Planck length, \( k \) is the Coulomb's constant, and \( q \) is the charge.\n
\n
- **Gravitational Force (FG):** The dimensions are `{Dimension(G): 1, Dimension(LP): -2, Dimension(mP): 2}`, which are also consistent with the dimensions of force. Here, \( mP \) likely represents the Planck mass, and \( LP \) the Planck length, which when used in the given equation \( G \cdot mP^2 / LP^2 \), yield the correct dimensions for gravitational force.\n
\n
These results indicate that the dimensions of the equations are consistent with the dimensions of force, which is a good sign that the equations are dimensionally valid. However, dimensional consistency does not necessarily imply physical validity. Further analysis would be required to test the physical validity of these equations, potentially through comparison with experimental data or conducting new experiments where possible.
