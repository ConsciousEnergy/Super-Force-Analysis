## Dimensional Analysis of Super Force Theory

The dimensional analysis of the Super Force theory's equations is a critical step in ensuring that the equations are dimensionally consistent and adhere to the principles of dimensional homogeneity. This analysis does not confirm the physical validity of the equations but checks whether the mathematical form of the equations is dimensionally sound.\n

### Superforce (SF)
The Superforce is defined by the equation \( SF = \frac{c^4}{G} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum, and \( G \) is the gravitational constant. The dimensions of the Superforce are `{Dimension(G): -1, Dimension(c): 4}`, indicating a force dimension of \( [MLT^{-2}] \).\n

### Strong Nuclear Force (FSN)
The Strong Nuclear Force at the Planck scale is given by the same equation as the Superforce, \( FSN = \frac{c^4}{G} \). Its dimensions are identical to that of the Superforce, which is consistent with the force dimension.\n

### Electromagnetic Force (FEM)
The Electromagnetic Force at the Planck scale can be expressed as \( FEM = \frac{1}{k} \frac{q^2}{LP^2} \), where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q \) is charge, and \( LP \) is the Planck length. The dimensions are `{Dimension(LP): -2, Dimension(k): -1, Dimension(q): 2}`, aligning with the force dimension.\n

### Gravitational Force (FG)
The Gravitational Force at the Planck scale is described by \( FG = G \frac{mP^2}{LP^2} \), where \( mP \) is the Planck mass, and \( LP \) is the Planck length. Its dimensions are `{Dimension(G): 1, Dimension(LP): -2, Dimension(mP): 2}`, which are consistent with the force dimension.\n

These results affirm that the equations are dimensionally consistent, providing a foundation for further investigation into their physical validity.
