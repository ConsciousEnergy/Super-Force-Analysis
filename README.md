# Super Force Dimensional Analysis

Welcome to the repository where theoretical physics meets rigorous scrutiny! This project delves into the fascinating realm of the Super Force theory, a conceptual framework that seeks to unify the fundamental forces of nature at the Planck scale.

## Overview

The Super Force theory posits a unified field at the Planck scale, where the strong nuclear force and gravity could be aspects of a single fundamental force. Our dimensional analysis is a pivotal step in assessing the plausibility of such a theory, laying the groundwork for potential empirical validation.

## What's Inside

- `Super_Force_Analysis.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the detailed dimensional analysis of the Super Force theory's equations.
- `Dimensional_Analysis_Results.md`: A markdown file summarizing the dimensional analysis results.
- `Experimental_Designs.md/`: A directory proposing experimental setups and simulations for empirical testing.
- `Literature_Review.md/`: A collection of scientific papers and articles relevant to the Super Force theory and dimensional analysis.

## Dimensional Analysis Highlights

- **Consistency with Force Dimensions**: Our analysis confirms that the Super Force theory's equations are dimensionally consistent with the known dimensions of force.
- **Unified Approach**: The Super Force and Strong Nuclear Force share a dimensional framework, suggesting a possible unification.
- **Planck Scale Resonance**: The dimensions of the Electromagnetic and Gravitational Forces align with established principles at the Planck scale.
